          <experience-instance company="Antmicro" period="Jan 2021 - now" title="Software Engineer I">
            <p>I joined here to help improve internal tools, as well as deliver marketing pages faster and with high quality. I created a website with easily editable content, built in gatsby (React framework) and worked on internal tool written in VueJS.</p>
          </experience-instance>
          <experience-instance company="HolidayCheck" period="Aug 2019 - Dec 2020" title="Software Engineer">
            <p>I worked on high traffic applications (more than millions unique visits per month) here, including conducting A/B/C/D tests on a page with highest traffic, using Optimizely. Main technologies here were React.js and TypeScript with support from Redux, Jest, SCSS but also styled-components (CSS-in-JS). I discovered benefits of software craftsmanship, learned to work in TDD, but also involved myself highly in product development.</p>
          </experience-instance>
          <experience-instance company="Kinguin" period="Nov 2017 - Jul 2019" title="Junior Software Engineer I">
            <p>I started to work as a Junior Quality Assurance Engineer, and I learned about rest automation, Continous Integration and Continous Delivery. Later I decided to switch my role to Frontend-focused Software Engineer. I worked mainly on React + Redux application, but also helped to create internal javascript packages library including authentication service (OAuth 2 flow). Moreover, I started to develop regression tests written in Cypress, suported by unit tests with Jest and Enzyme.</p>

          <experience-instance company="Pearson IOKI" period="Jun 2017 - Aug 2017" title="IT Itern (Frontend)">
            <p>It was my first experience with web development. I learned about Angular framework, helped to fix bugs and change translation library for a high traffic application. I also learned how to use Docker containers and how to control code version with git.</p>

          <experience-instance company="Master of science" period="2015 - 2017" title="Astronomy">
            <p>In my masters degree I started to use Python as my main programming language, to write scientific scripts and for the application of numerical methods. For my master thesis I worked with automation pipeline for observations reduction and wrote python script to create light curves, that can be seen for example on http://www.gaiagosa.eu/observation-processing.</p>

          </experience-instance>
          <experience-instance company="Development directions">
            <p>Although I like working in React environment, I would like to gather more experience in other JS frameworks (VueJS or Svelte) as well as move into fullstack development (Currently I  mainly understand how back-end and infrastructure works, but have small or none experience implementing it). Technologies, that recently appeared on my radar are WebAssembly and Web Components.</p>
            <p>Besides web development I am fascinated by data visualisation and how it can improve decision making process.</p>
            <p>I am also constantly trying to improve my design skills (this CV is created in Figma ðŸ™‚), and learn more about UX patterns</p>
